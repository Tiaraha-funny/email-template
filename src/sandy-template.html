    I am just checking in again whether you could consider Noeline for your
    team. She's super motivated and would love a chance to prove herself to you!

    I also thought it might be nice to explain a little more about how Onja
    brings careers to the world's most underprivileged students while also
    bringing big value to the companies that hire them.

        Sandy grew up in Antanandava, a small village in Madagascar. In 2018 she
        graduated high school scoring in the top 1% of her peers but her parents
        could not afford to put her through university. Sandy&rsquo;s parents
        are, like most Malagasy people, small-scale farmers. &nbsp;After high
        school, she started to help her parents on the farm but she was not
        challenged or excited about her future.
      </li>
      <li style="text-align: justify">
        We identified Sandy and offered her a place in our world-class,
        intensive training program. In January 2019 she began studying. At the
        time Sandy could barely speak a word of English and had never even
        touched a computer before! In just 12 months Sandy became an advanced
        English speaker (C1 level) and within two-and-a-half years she started
        working as a professional software developer for one of our partner
        companies in the UK!

      A short word from Sandy :
      <em
        >"I had never heard of coding before and I came here to Onja in the hope
        of getting a good salary as a developer so that I can help pay for the
        education of my younger brothers and sisters. Now I am a professional
        front-end developer at a UK software consultancy and have gained a lot
        of experience contributing to business applications using Pure
        Javascript, React, Shopify, Liquid, Hugo, and CSS/SCSS."</em

    Let us provide you with highly motivated and talented developers like Sandy
