        “It’s very easy to see how much Rinon has progressed since he joined our team. His coding skills are getting better every day, he takes ownership of any task and is always looking for more ways to improve his code and delivery everything with good attention to detail. His proactivity and “can-do” attitude inspires and pushes the whole team to learn and collaborate more sharing knowledge and testing new technologies relevant for our daily work. Rinon is definitely on the right path, smashing bugs and turning more tickets than the whole team, and doing all that with a good positive attitude!”
